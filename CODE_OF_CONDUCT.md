# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to understand and enforce that: this is a project, not a government; there will be a focus on the project.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Focusing on the project
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Accepting debate over ideas/approaches/etc.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Dragging parts of peoples lives outside of this project into this project, including but not limited to:
	* Their age, body size, disability or disorder, race, ethnicity, sex characteristics, identity and expression or lack thereof, formal education or lack thereof, personal appearance, or religion.
	* Their actions outside of this project. Many people struggle with mental illness, especially with personality disorders. Just because someone struggles with controlling their behavior, does not mean they should be kept from contributing to this project, if they are behaving themselves within this projects space.
* Political discussions
* Sexual discussions, commentary, innuendos, etc.
* Publishing others personal information; doxxing
* Essentially anything not directly related to this project

## Responsibilities & Enforcement

I, Patrick Kelly (_Entomy_), am solely responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable and unacceptable behavior, as well as temporary or permanent bans of contributers for repeated behaviors in violation of the Code of Conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Protections

All contributors are to be warned, with detailed explaination and citation, of their violation and be asked to correct it, before corrective action is made against them, excluding cases of generally illegal activity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct only applies within the project space. That should be pretty obvious. If it's not to you, I think you need to think long and hard about why this project would have any kind of authority over someones life outside of it.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) but with considerably modifications, such as a reduction of wokeness, increased awareness about peoples struggle with mental illness, and considerably decreased authoritarian attitude. It should not be thought of as having any relation to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), it was just being read as this Code of Conduct was written.
